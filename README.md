### Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are greatly appreciated.

If you'd like to contribute to **Mini-Web-Eggstravaganza**, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Project**
   - This is the first step. By forking the repository, you create a personal copy of the project in your own GitHub account. This allows you to experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
   - To do this, simply click on the **Fork** button on the top-right of the GitHub repository page.
   
2. **Create your Feature Branch**  
   - After forking, clone the repository to your local machine, navigate to the repository folder, and then create a new feature branch. Branching keeps your changes separate from the main codebase and allows you to work on different features without disrupting the stable code.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature
     ```

3. **Commit your Changes**  
   - Once youâ€™ve made your desired changes or added a new feature, commit the changes. This records the modifications youâ€™ve made to the project. It's important to write clear, descriptive commit messages so that others can understand the purpose of your changes.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'
     ```

4. **Push to the Branch**  
   - Push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub. This updates your remote feature branch with the latest commit.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/AmazingFeature
     ```

5. **Open a Pull Request**  
   - Now that your changes are in your own forked repository, the final step is to open a pull request. This is where you propose your changes to the original repository. GitHub will display a visual comparison of the differences between your branch and the original repository.
   - After reviewing your changes, repository maintainers will decide whether to merge your contributions into the main codebase.
